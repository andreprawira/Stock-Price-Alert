# Stock-Price-Alert
Get a notification through email when your choice of stock change price hits a certain threshold  If you want to customize the code, make sure you read the comments and change whatever needs to be changed. In my case, I use Google email account, turn on 2 step verification, and turn on Google less secure app, then you generate a password specific for Google email. Then, create an account in https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ and upload the script and run it there.
